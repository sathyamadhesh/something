WEB SERVICES DESCRIPTION:

The Ticker application is implemented using rest services using grails. The services are independent of client side and can be used for any devices. The web services are called using angular js controller which is a JavaScript framework.

The  services are implemented using Grails. User is authenticated by Authentication Token, which is unique for every user and generated by hashing his email and login time. Authentication token is made null on Logout which is used for userâ€™s session maintenance.

In order to save data in database, angular controller converts it into JSON and sends it to Grails Controller and hence it is saved in Database. To fetch Data from database, request sent goes to angular and it calls the grails service and retrieves data and returns it to angular. Hence the JSON object is displayed to the user.
